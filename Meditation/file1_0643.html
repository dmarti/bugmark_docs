XVII. Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of
the mind and understanding, <b>which</b> to be aware of,
thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest
discover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself
concerning every one of them, This imagination is not
necessary; this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak as
another man's <b>slave,</b> or instrument; than which
nothing can be more senseless and absurd: for the fourth,
thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that thou
doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become
subject <b>and</b> obnoxious to that more ignoble part of
thy body, and the gross lusts and concupiscences thereof.
