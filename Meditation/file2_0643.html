XV. If it were thine act and <b>in</b> thine own power,
wouldest thou do it? If it were not, whom dost tin accuse?
the atoms, or the Gods? For to do either, the part of a mad
man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but if it be in thy
power, redress what <b>is</b> amiss; if it be not, to what
end is it to complain? For nothing should <b>be</b> done but
to some certain end.
